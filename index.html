      <p>Common snook (Centropomus Undecimalis) are found in coastal waters ranging along the eastern and western coast of Florida, the Texas coast and south to Brazil. Although primarily a saltwater species, they have been known to occupy coastal freshwater habitats. Snook generally have a long, silver body with a light olive/brown back but their coloration may reflect more closely their environment. Their most distinguishing feature, however, is the single black lateral line running from the top of the gill cover to the end of the caudal fin. While three to 20-pound fish are most common, female snook can reach lengths up to 48 inches while the males can grow to around 39 inches. The current world record is a 53 pound, 10 ounce fish caught in Costa Rica while the U.S. record is a 44 pound, 3 ounce Florida specimen.

Snook are one of the most sought after inshore game fish due to their willingness to eat a variety of baits, vicious strikes, hard fights and as a delicious table fare. Within their range, snook can be found across various habitats, from grass flats, inlets, sand bars, bridges, beaches and mangroves. Setting up in areas with strong tidal flows can be the key to a successful trip. Live baitfish, shrimp, crabs and numerous types of artificial baits can all be used to entice snook as long as they are in the mood to eat. However, there are special snook regulations in most regions to be aware of before pursing this species.</p>
